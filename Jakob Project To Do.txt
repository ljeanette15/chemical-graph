Jakob Project To Do:

Steps toward a potential paper:
	

H4 ground state VQE:
- what's the current bottleneck in classical computing? 
	- is it the orbital optimization or the energy measurement


H4 excited state overlap circuit:
- with no hardware optimization, the H4 circuit takes 8 qubits
- the H4 ground state preparation has been done 





Preparing a ground state wavefunction (from Jonas):
1. Define molecule
2. Get Hamiltonian from molecule
3. Get unitary using separated pair approximation
4. Add an orbital rotation to the unitary from (3)
5. Get objective function from this U and H (expectation value)
6. Minimize this objective function to get optimal variables

Getting the excited state overlap (from Jakob):
1. Define molecule
2. Get Hamiltonian from molecule
3. Transform molecule to HCB approximation
4. Get unitary using separated pair approximation
5. Get objective function from this U and H (no extra orbital rotation?)
6. Minimize objective to get ground state - fix variables in unitary now
7. Repeat (4) which will now be for the excited state
8. Get Hamiltonian in the atomic basis
9. Add basis rotation (to excited state?) and change of basis from hardcore bosons back to fermions
10. Get expectation value for overlap (H = 0 state, U = combined unitary)
